This program search for CMS papers on the Cern Document Server, and creates a
list in [[twiki.org][TWiki]] syntax.

Two output files are generated: a temporary file (which can be used with the option '-n'), and the file containing the output in TWiki syntax.

Programs like vimdiff can help to merge this output file to already created TWiki pages.
